    SQLAlchemy needs an explicit driver, so both forms are rewritten to
    ``postgresql+psycopg://``. When the variable is empty or missing we fall

    renders a form, then returns 500 on every page that runs a query, because
    the SQLite file it invented has no tables in it. The symptom looks like a
