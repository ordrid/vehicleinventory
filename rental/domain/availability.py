"""Whether a vehicle can be booked for a particular date range.

The rule the requirements state, and the one thing the whole phase-1 design
turns on: a vehicle's `status` describes it *now*, while bookability is a
question about a *range*. A vehicle rented this week is bookable next month, so
RESERVED and RENTED are never blanket refusals -- only the dates decide.

This module takes plain intervals, never ORM rows. The caller queries the
pending and confirmed reservations, the active rentals and the uncompleted
maintenance windows and converts them, which keeps query logic out of the rule
and lets every case here be tested without a database.
